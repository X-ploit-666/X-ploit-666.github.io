In addition, our foamed ceramic components also have high strength, waterproof, and corrosion resistance characteristics and are suitable for various construction fields such as residential and commercial buildings.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Foamed Ceramic Component\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/g8jwCGW2rqw?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"235*115*100mm","offer_id":44426904961264,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SFCCA49.jpg?v=1705042812"},{"product_id":"sfcca50","title":"SFCCA50","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe foamed ceramic components are manufactured by high-temperature technology, have a porous material structure, and are cut into shapes.
