    <td colspan="2"><p data-mce-fragment="1">Jade glass usually shows the color and texture of natural jade, such as bluish-white, dark green, and so on. At the same time, unique patterns and textures can be created through melting and mixing techniques to increase their decorative effect. Jade glass has the high hardness and wear resistance of natural stone and, at the same time, has the transparency and light refraction effect of glass. It's also water-resistant, easy to clean, and chemical-resistant, making it ideal for high-end finishes.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">These materials show unique beauty and characteristics in architectural decoration, and through their application, they can bring stunning, modern, and elegant decorative effects to the space. Whether it is a commercial or private residence, they can add a unique charm and artistic atmosphere to the space.</p>
