It usually involves beating, picking, washing, drying, twisting, planing, peeling, bleaching, dyeing, weaving, and painting. Several processes take full advantage of the characteristics of rattan which are soft and not easy to break. Rattan is strong and durable, not only not easily deformed, but also insect-proof and moth-proof. In terms of color, rattan weaving mostly uses the light yellow color of the original rattan, but it can also be bleached and colored in white or ivory, which makes it appear soft and elegant. Some are paired with coffee, brown, etc. Rattan materials have the characteristics of natural beauty, lightness, durability, breathability, and environmental sustainability. It is commonly used in the production of furniture, decorations, and wall partitions.</span></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p data-mce-fragment="1">Rattan weaving is mainly made from rattan skin or young rattan core. It usually involves beating, picking, washing, drying, twisting, planing, peeling, bleaching, dyeing, weaving, and painting. Several processes take full advantage of the characteristics of rattan which are soft and not easy to break. Rattan is strong and durable, not only not easily deformed, but also insect-proof and moth-proof. In terms of color, rattan weaving mostly uses the light yellow color of the original rattan, but it can also be bleached and colored in white or ivory, which makes it appear soft and elegant. Some are paired with coffee, brown, etc. Rattan materials have the characteristics of natural beauty, lightness, durability, breathability, and environmental sustainability. It is commonly used in the production of furniture, decorations, and wall partitions.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p data-mce-fragment="1">Rattan weaving is mainly made from rattan skin or young rattan core. It usually involves beating, picking, washing, drying, twisting, planing, peeling, bleaching, dyeing, weaving, and painting. Several processes take full advantage of the characteristics of rattan which are soft and not easy to break. Rattan is strong and durable, not only not easily deformed, but also insect-proof and moth-proof. In terms of color, rattan weaving mostly uses the light yellow color of the original rattan, but it can also be bleached and colored in white or ivory, which makes it appear soft and elegant. Some are paired with coffee, brown, etc. Rattan materials have the characteristics of natural beauty, lightness, durability, breathability, and environmental sustainability. It is commonly used in the production of furniture, decorations, and wall partitions.</p>
