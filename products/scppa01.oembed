Its core is fiber-reinforced concrete and ultra-light composite materials, and a protective film is sprayed on the surface. On the premise of maintaining the original concrete texture, our cement pouring panel achieves a more efficient and convenient installation effect than concrete. It is more durable and weather-resistant and has a wide range of applications, including the interior and exterior walls and ceilings of commercial spaces such as office buildings, hotels, and exhibition halls.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Cement Pouring Panel\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kSR2CNZ2UZg?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"3*1240*3250mm \/ Clear water cement color","offer_id":44423973044464,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SCPPA01.jpg?v=1703037421","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/scppa01","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
