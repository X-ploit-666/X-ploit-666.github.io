{"product_id":"sutma09","title":"SUTMA09","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThere is a stone that can be bent, light-transmitting, and has a variety of shapes, which completely subverts your perception of stone. It is ultra-thin marble. Its thickness is 1-3mm. The beautiful stone texture combined with lighting and shape can easily create a natural, comfortable and romantic atmosphere for any space.But don't look at its thinness. In terms of retaining the texture of stone, ultra-thin marble has also achieved the ultimate. It uses layered natural stone materials such as slate and sandstone in nature, and uses modern nanotechnology to peel them off in layers to retain the texture of the stone to the greatest extent while ensuring the characteristics of lightness and thinness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Ultra-Thin Marble\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LywnS32pCCY?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"1220*2440mm","offer_id":44426808656112,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false},{"title":"1220*610mm","offer_id":44426808688880,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SUTMA09.jpg?v=1705040135","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/sutma09","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
