Compared with traditional cement, microcement wall panels have been pre-treated, and their surfaces are more delicate and textured, and are not prone to cracking. Whether used on walls or floors, there is no need to worry about service life. As long as the base layer is properly treated, it will be pressure-resistant and wear-resistant. The strength cannot be underestimated. Designed to meet our customers' creative needs, our microcement wall panel offers endless color and finish possibilities, making it the ideal finishing material for those with very specific color needs.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Microcement Wall Panel\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UhDTK7eG9k4?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":44982202794224,"sku":"","price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/187c07c944253458c870eb65e2e6eb99.jpg?v=1705889712","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/swpsa500-%e5%be%ae%e6%b0%b4%e6%b3%a5%e6%8a%a4%e5%a2%99%e6%9d%bf","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
