{"product_id":"seta08","title":"SETA08","description":"\u003cp\u003eElectroplated travertine uses travertine as the base material. It uses an electrolysis process to deposit metal or alloy on the surface of natural stone to form a metal coating, giving it a futuristic metallic luster. This surface coating can prevent oxidation and rust, improve wear reflectivity and corrosion resistance, and enhance aesthetics. With its excellent texture and flexibility in matching, electroplated travertine has become the material of choice for high-end places such as CBD business districts, hotel spaces, and villa buildings.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Electroplated Marble\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uZ5bqdOt5Bk?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"50*300*8mm","offer_id":44426785751280,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SETA08.jpg?v=1705045230","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/seta08","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
