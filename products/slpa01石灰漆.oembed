{"product_id":"slpa01石灰漆","title":"SLPA01","description":"\u003cp\u003eLime paint can be used indoors or outdoors, and unlike most paints that only adhere to the surface of a material, lime paint sinks deep into the material, so it can be used on porous, uneven surfaces such as stucco, wood, stone, or brick. Today lime paint is widely used to create natural finishes with a rustic, cozy charm, where imperfections brought out by natural characteristics speak to the ineffable wabi-sabi aesthetic. It’s worth noting that all lime paint colors, mixed with mineral tones, offer a soft look that complements most decor styles. Choosing the right colors can influence the emotions users feel in a space, with neutral tones bringing peace and bright colors stimulating a sense of well-being.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Lime Paint\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ncstA4NndaE?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":44946718294256,"sku":"","price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/ca176a018c6beb355461ec2fbce2b581.jpg?v=1705112813","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/slpa01%e7%9f%b3%e7%81%b0%e6%bc%86","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
