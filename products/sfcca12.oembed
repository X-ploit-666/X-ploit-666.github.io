{"product_id":"sfcca12","title":"SFCCA12","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe foamed ceramic components are manufactured by high-temperature technology, have a porous material structure, and are cut into shapes. It is a relatively lightweight material among solid wall materials, which can effectively reduce construction loads. Its microporous structure and porosity make it an excellent sound-absorbing material that can effectively reduce noise. At the same time, it has the advantages of flame retardancy and heat preservation. In addition, our foamed ceramic components also have high strength, waterproof, and corrosion resistance characteristics and are suitable for various construction fields such as residential and commercial buildings.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Foamed Ceramic Component\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/g8jwCGW2rqw?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"230*115*100mm","offer_id":44426903748848,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SFCCA12.jpg?v=1705042286","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/sfcca12","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
