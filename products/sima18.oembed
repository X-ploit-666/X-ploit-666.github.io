Immortal moss can maintain a fresh appearance for a long time, saving time and effort in daily maintenance. It requires no light, no watering, no fertilization, and no pruning. The processed immortal moss is lightweight and does not require soil or planting pots during installation. It is not limited by the wall structure and is easier to design three-dimensional shapes. As a decorative painting, immortal moss can add a natural flavor to indoor spaces and regulate environmental noise problems. Combining lighting and intelligent design can also enable various creative DIYs.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Immortal Moss\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8tdMwFy3H6U?list=PLm7b9pSG0eYiSbtODVNOmHjdwgi2B1IB5\" height=\"702\" width=\"1248\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"STARMAXDESIGN","offers":[{"title":"382*192*92mm \/ PALE YELLOWISH GREEN","offer_id":44426803577072,"sku":null,"price":0.0,"currency_code":"CNY","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0670\/1944\/0368\/files\/SIMA18.jpg?v=1703472480","url":"https:\/\/www.starmaxdesign.com\/products\/sima18","provider":"STARMAXDESIGN","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
